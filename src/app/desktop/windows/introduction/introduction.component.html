    <!--<h2>A short Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to Cryptic. Cryptic is a hacker browsergame. Within this project, the further education and training of people<br>
    interested in computer science is promoted through the development of a game. And this is the game we are talking about.<br>
    </p>


    <p>You could start the game, with building your first device, by clicking the big green Button. After that, you can connect<br>
      to your device by clicking the blue screen.<br></p>



    <p>The next step could be a wallet. You need a wallet for many things. If you hacked a device of another player you can rob<br>
      him, and steal all his morphcoin(The ingame currency), or you can use the miner app to mine your own morphcoin. You see,<br>
      these are only two possibilities in a whole world so, what are you waiting for. Start your device and become the best<br>
      player. Gain access over tons of devices and build your hacking empire.<br></p>



    You can reach this text by clicking the introduction tab in the control center on the left side.<br>
